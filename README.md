## Intorduction
The objective of this project was to identify undervalued NBA players from the 2021-22 season and assemble a team composed of such players. The project subsequently employs machine learning algorithms to predict the number of team wins based on relevant metrics, which will be elaborated upon in later sections

## Data
### 2021-22 Player Statistics
I got this data set from [Basketball Reference 2021-22 player statsitcs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_game.html) using their "Share & Export" function that allows you to export the data to a csv file. I did this for both the "Per Game" and "Advanced" statsitcs pages. As well as I there is an option to "Hide Partail Rows" that hides the multiple rows of a player statsitcs. This occurs when a player is either traded or realsed and signed by a new team during the NBA season. Then manualy combing the two datasets into one using Excel, givng me one collective dataset with both "Per Game" and "Advanced" statsitcs.

### 2021-22 Player Salaries
I got this data from web scrapping the [ESPN NBA Player Salaries 2021-2022](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/_/year/2022) using python. You can find the code I used for this here. It should noted that I could never figure out a way to elminate the code from printing "NAME" and "SALARY" as new data when trying the different pages of the data source. So due to this I had to manually delete the duplicate values in the Excel file.

### Cleaning and Merging the Datasets
In order to properly join these two dataset it required some cleaning up at first.

First, I deleted the players who had null values in their statistics, except for the "3P%" column. This mainly occurred for players who play the center position ("C"). Since a team requires a center, I did not want to eliminate centers from this project. Therefore, I chose to allow players with null values in this particular column.

Then I decided to clean up the players statisitics database first. My first move was to delete the first column of the database as it would be of no use as it's ranks Basketball Reference ranking of the players and would be no use for this project.

Next I had to simply the players names in order to get them to merge together the two datasets as I would be using the player names as the unique identifer to link their statsitcs to the salary they recived in the 2021-22 season.
 - Removed special characters from names (Ex: DragiÄ‡ -> Dragic)
 - Removed "III", "II", "Jr", "Sr", and "." the ends of player names

Then after merging these two databases togehter I was left with 440 rows or players to analyze.

## Looking For Undervalued Players
In my analysis of NBA players, I used the formula Value = (PER + BPM + VORP) / 3 to determine each player's overall value, with the prerequisite that players must have played a minimum of 20 games and 15 minutes per game to be included in the analysis. This formula takes into account a player's efficiency (as measured by player efficiency rating, or PER), his impact on his team's performance (as measured by box plus/minus, or BPM), and his value compared to replacement-level players (as measured by value over replacement player, or VORP). By combining these metrics, the formula provides a comprehensive assessment of a player's contributions on both ends of the court. A higher value score indicates a more valuable player, and by comparing players' value scores, it's possible to identify undervalued players who may be overlooked by other metrics or rankings.

In order to further refine my analysis and evaluate players' value more accurately, I also factored in each player's salary using the formula Value per Salary = Value / Salary. This formula allows for a direct comparison of players' value per dollar of salary, which can help identify players who may be providing good value for their salary or those who may be overpaid.

For example, a player with a high value score may not necessarily be a good value if he is being paid a large salary. On the other hand, a player with a lower value score may be considered a good value if he is being paid a relatively small salary.

By combining the Value formula with the Value per Salary formula, I was able to identify players who were both highly valuable and providing good value for their salary. This allowed me to create a more comprehensive evaluation of each player's worth and to make more informed decisions when assessing player value, while ensuring that only players who met the minimum playing time requirements were included in the analysis.
