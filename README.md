## Intorduction
The objective of this project was to identify undervalued NBA players from the 2021-22 season and assemble a team composed of such players. The project subsequently employs a formula to predict the number of team wins based on relevant metrics, which will be elaborated upon in later sections

## Data
### 2021-22 Player Statistics
I got this data set from [Basketball Reference 2021-22 player statsitcs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_game.html) using their "Share & Export" function that allows you to export the data to a csv file. I did this for both the "Per Game" and "Advanced" statsitcs pages. As well as I there is an option to "Hide Partail Rows" that hides the multiple rows of a player statsitcs. This occurs when a player is either traded or realsed and signed by a new team during the NBA season. Then manualy combing the two datasets into one using Excel, givng me one collective dataset with both "Per Game" and "Advanced" statsitcs.

### 2021-22 Player Salaries
I got this data from web scrapping the [NBA Player Salaries 2021-2022](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/2021-2022/) using python. You can find the code I used for this here. It should noted that I could never figure out a way to elminate the code from printing "NAME" and "SALARY" as new data when trying the different pages of the data source. So due to this I had to manually delete the duplicate values in the Excel file.

### Cleaning and Merging the Datasets
In order to properly join these two dataset it required some cleaning up at first.

First, I deleted the players who had null values in their statistics, except for the "3P%" column. This mainly occurred for players who play the center position ("C"). Since a team requires a center, I did not want to eliminate centers from this project. Therefore, I chose to allow players with null values in this particular column.

Then I decided to clean up the players statisitics database first. My first move was to delete the first column of the database as it would be of no use as it's ranks Basketball Reference ranking of the players and would be no use for this project.

Next I had to simply the players names in order to get them to merge together the two datasets as I would be using the player names as the unique identifer to link their statsitcs to the salary they recived in the 2021-22 season.
 - Removed special characters from names (Ex: DragiÄ‡ -> Dragic)
 - Removed "III", "II", "Jr", "Sr", and "." the ends of player names

Then after merging these two databases togehter I was left with 478 rows or players to analyze.

## Looking For Undervalued Players
In my analysis of NBA players, I used the formula of Value = (PER + BPM + VORP) / 3 to determine each player's overall value, with the prerequisite that players must have played a minimum of 25 games and 17 minutes per game to be included in the analysis. I chose those two parameters in my analysis players to ensure that the players included in the analysis have played enough games and minutes to have a significant impact on their team's performance. These requirements also help to filter out players who may have had a small sample size of playing time, which could lead to skewed data and inaccurate conclusions. This formula takes into account a player's efficiency (as measured by player efficiency rating, or PER), his impact on his team's performance (as measured by box plus/minus, or BPM), and his value compared to replacement-level players (as measured by value over replacement player, or VORP). the purpose of dividing the sum of the three metrics by 3 is to find the average value of a player's efficiency, impact on team performance, and value compared to replacement-level players. This allows for a more balanced evaluation of a player's overall value, rather than overemphasizing one metric over the others. By dividing the sum by 3, each metric is given equal weight in the calculation of a player's value..By combining these metrics, the formula provides a comprehensive assessment of a player's contributions on both ends of the court. A higher value score indicates a more valuable player, and by comparing players' value scores, it's possible to identify undervalued players who may be overlooked by other metrics or rankings.

In order to further refine my analysis and evaluate players' value more accurately, I also factored in each player's salary using the formula Value per Salary = Value / Salary. This formula allows for a direct comparison of players' value per dollar of salary, which can help identify players who may be providing good value for their salary or those who may be overpaid.

For example, a player with a high value score may not necessarily be a good value if he is being paid a large salary. On the other hand, a player with a lower value score may be considered a good value if he is being paid a relatively small salary.

By combining the Value formula with the Value per Salary formula, I was able to identify players who were both highly valuable and providing good value for their salary. This allowed me to create a more comprehensive evaluation of each player's worth and to make more informed decisions when assessing player value, while ensuring that only players who met the minimum playing time requirements were included in the analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visulation
After cleaning up the data source, I then added it to Tableau visualization software. With this, I was able to create an interactive dashboard that allows the user to filter the results by position and show the top-ranked player at the selected position determined by their VPS score. Along with this, the dashboard showed the average salary and player value for the selected position, followed by a scatter plot that used player salary as the x-axis and player value as the y-axis. These dashboard features changed as the user selected a position. This dashboard can be viewed at [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/taylor.locke4701/viz/NBAMoneyball2021-22/Dashboard1).

The results of this project, looking into finding the most undervalued player of the 2021-22 NBA season using a formula of Value = (PER + BPM + VORP) / 3, are as follows:

PG: Immanuel Quickley<br>
SF: Caleb Martin<br>
SG: Lindy Waters<br>
PF: Terry Taylor<br>
 C: Isaiah Hartenstein<br>
 
## Final Thoughts
Looking forward, I hope to further explore this dataset using machine learning techniques to identify patterns and insights that may not be immediately apparent. By using more advanced models, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to a player's value and potentially discover new metrics that can enhance our evaluation. Overall, this project provides a valuable starting point for analyzing NBA player performance, but there is still much to be explored and discovered in this field. It is important to note that there is no one right way to determine a player's value. The inclusion of additional metrics or the use of different weighting schemes may yield different results.
