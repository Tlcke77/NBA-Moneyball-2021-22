## Intorduction
The objective of this project was to identify undervalued NBA players from the 2021-22 season and assemble a team composed of such players. The project subsequently employs machine learning algorithms to predict the number of team wins based on relevant metrics, which will be elaborated upon in later sections

## Data
### 2021-22 Player Statistics
I got this data set from https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_game.html using their "Share & Export" function that allows you to export the data to a csv file. I did this for both the "Per Game" and "Advanced" statsitcs pages. Then manualy combing the two datasets into one using Excel, givng me one collective dataset with both "Per Game" and "Advanced" statsitcs.
